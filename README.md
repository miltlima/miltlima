📐 **Open source Personal Projects**

```text
- 📦 Secrethor – A Kubernetes Operator written in Go to enforce **Secret governance policie.  
  It validates Secret creation based on rules like allowed types, required keys, forbidden keys,  
  value constraints, and expiration time. Built for secure and GitOps-driven environments.

- 📦 Secrethor CLI – A companion CLI tool to the Secrethor Operator.  
  It allows local auditing of Kubernetes Secrets, with features like orphan detection,  
  name-based search across namespaces, and upcoming validations based on CRD policies  
  such as expiration and structure compliance.

- 📦 Terramagic CLI – Automatically generates a folder structure for Terraform files.  
  Helps standardize Infrastructure-as-Code projects and keeps everything organized from the start.

- 📦 Kubelearn CLI/Dash – Written in Go, this tool helps you improve your Kubernetes knowledge  
  through interactive challenges. You answer questions by creating Kubernetes objects —  
  your answers are only valid if the created resources match the expected result.

- 📦 lookr CLI – Scans your AWS account and lists which resources are currently in use.  
  Useful for quick audits and identifying leftovers or undocumented resources.

- 📦 kom CLI – Displays real-time metrics from **pods** and **nodes** in Kubernetes.  
  Great for a quick overview of cluster usage without relying on external dashboards.

- 📦 goact CLI – Generates GitHub Actions workflows and Dockerfiles for specific tech stacks.  
  Speeds up CI/CD setup and helps maintain best practices from the beginning.
